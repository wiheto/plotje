Small quick styling function for matplotlib.

So while there are some default styles to matplotlib and the ability to make an entire template. I made plottje as a quick way to edit matplotlib figures to give them a slightly better look.

Some of the benefits include:

1. Simple theme that minimizes graph clutter.
2. Allows for parameter dictionaries for consistent parameters across subplots. 
3. Easier legends and colorbars.
